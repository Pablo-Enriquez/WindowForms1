Project title: Advanced Windows Forms

#Purpose: the purpose of this project is to create an application that models Model, view and controller. I have saved in seperate folders for each. #This will be a continuation of the WindowsForm assignment and we will add the following: The ability to associate an image with each object you arestoring. They will be shown in a picture box. The picture box will update to show the image associated with the currently selected object.

#2. The ability to save the objects to a text file and to one of the alternative file formats: bin, xml, or js on. If the file saves successfully, the application will show a success message; otherwise, it will display an error message.

#3. The ability to load the objects from a text file and from one of the alternative file formats: bin, xml, or json. If t he objects are read successfully, they replace the objects the controller had managed; otherwise, the previous set of objects remain.

#4. The ability to display and edit details about the current set of objects using a grid. The grid should appear as part of a modal dialog form. The changes you make using the data grid must be reflected on the main form when you return to it.

#5. The ability to see an About dialog that displays details about the application.

#6. The ability to control some aspect of the objects you are storing using one additional type of componentâ€“ a checkbox, or a radio button, or a list box, etc
